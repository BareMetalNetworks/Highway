# Highway
CLI REPL for managing infrastructure and services en masse or singular. Initially using ssh for communication, eventually a more native seeming approach (from the apps perspective) will be implemented.


## TODO ##
* Need to cleanup the interface before i can call this a release
* Future features list
* REPL and vanilla command line versions
